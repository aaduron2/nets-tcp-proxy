# nets-tcp-proxy

This repo contains a demo
* tcp echo server that accepts multiple concurrent client connections
* tcp echo client that makes multiple concurrent requests to a server
* "stammering" tcp proxy that illustrates how, unlike udp, tcp transmits a stream rather than complete messages. 

All programs include a `--usage` option.
